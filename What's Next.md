## TODO FUTURE

- combine usePeople functions into 1, same with players
- create helper functions for all Date events (send to google calendar, with time, without time, etc)
- in CreateGameForm/CreateEventForm, I use StyledSelect instead of my Select Component because I need to pass the arguments into the options but because I have default values, I created it differently. Can I recreate the StyledSelects with new options?
- create file upload page for team pics, player pics, etc - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvOvdD2nX1k
- useMutation in create playerForm does not run on create parents because of iterations. If you can understand the useMutation hook later on as a developer, fix it
