//TODO FIX FIXME
on create Form, only update location on opponent change only if not home
GOOGLE and the whole sign in issue
Don't allow game delete if not signed in (will delete from db but not calendar)

//TODO FUTURE
in CreateGameForm, I use StyledSelect instead of my Select Component because I need to pass the arguments into the options but because I have default values, I created it differently. Can I recreate the StyledSelects with new options?
